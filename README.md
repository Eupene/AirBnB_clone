AirBnB Clone Project
Introduction
In this project, the group members, Eunice Hogba and Zerebel Tanu built the foundation for a web application inspired by AirBnB. Our goal is to create a command-line interpreter that manages AirBnB objects, laying the groundwork for future development stages such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end design.

Project Overview

To start our project, we focused on developing a command-line interpreter that handles AirBnB objects. This initial step is crucial, as it served as the backbone for our subsequent project phases. By the end of this phase, we  achieved the following:

Create a parent class, BaseModel, responsible for object initialization, serialization, and deserialization.

Establish a streamlined flow of serialization and deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.

Define and implement classes for various AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place), all of which will inherit from BaseModel.

Introduce a file storage system, serving as the first abstracted storage engine for the project.

Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of our classes and storage engine.

Command Interpreter

The heart of our project is the command interpreter. This interpreter  resemble a simplified version of the Shell, tailored to our specific needs. With the command interpreter, we were able to perform the following actions:

Create new objects, such as Users or Places.

Retrieve objects from files or databases.

Perform operations on objects, including counting and computing statistics.

Update attributes of existing objects.

Remove objects from the system.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, we gained a deeper understanding of essential programming concepts and tools such as ;

Create a Python package to organize and manage your code.

Develop a command interpreter using Python's cmd module.

Implement unit testing practices for a large-scale project.

Serialize and deserialize class instances for storage and retrieval.

Write and read JSON files to manage data persistence.

Work with datetime and UUID modules to handle time-related and unique identifiers.

Utilize *args and **kwargs to handle flexible argument passing in functions.

Manage named arguments effectively in function definitions.

Copyright and Plagiarism

As responsible learners and developers, it's essential to uphold ethical practices and as such the team worked by solving the tasks independently even though solutions were available online..

Tools Used for the Projects

Python Scripts

Editors: vi, vim, emacs.

Code was interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5).

All modules ended with a new line.

The first line of each module was #!/usr/bin/python3.

A README.md file is available is at the root of the project folder.

All code adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.

Modules are  executable.

Modules, classes, and functions have appropriate documentation. This documentation explains the purpose and functionality of the module, class, or method.

Conclusion

Embarking on this project has helped the team master the command interpreter and gained valuable skills that will serve as a strong foundation for the rest of our web application development.
